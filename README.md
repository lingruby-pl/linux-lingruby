###### Patches developed and offered only for the last, stable line (not EOL). 
###### Active support is offered only for this kernel line. 
###### Any others are not supported anymore, but you can find patchsets for previous versions of kernel in "archive" directory. 
###### The patchset not includes upstream bugfixes patches from kernel line 5.XX. 
###### You should applied them on your own. It should be possible to applied patchset on any supported version of kernel, but I personally support only the last possible version of kernel from stable branch.
###### The patchset contains various patches developed by their authors, always in the newest versions and sometimes with fixes from master branch or from the other authors when it's necessary.

###### Some patches for BFQ/block-stable conflict with patches for BFQ-dev/block-mainline.

###### To use lucjan-kernels smoothly apply ll-reverts before linux-lucjan patch. Otherwise the kernel will not compile.

# Enable zstd compressed modules

###### To build a kernel with modules compressed in zstd format, insert any character here (it can be "y", "x" or any other value):

```
### Enable MODULE_COMPRESS_ZSTD
# WARNING Not recommended.
# An experimental solution, still in testing phase.
# Possible compilation and installation errors.
# Leave it unselected.
# However, if you want to test the new solution,
# first install mkinitcpio-zstd and kmod-zstd
# https://gitlab.com/sirlucjan/lucjan-kernels/-/tree/master/depends
_zstd_modules=
```
###### Remember that to do this you need to install modified versions of kmod (kmod-zstd) and mkinitcpio (mkinitcpio-zstd). To do this, run the following command:

```
cd /some_path/lucjan-kernels/depends/package_name
makepkg -srci

```

###### NOTE: mkinitcpio-zstd will overwrite the mkinitcpio.conf file and the old one will be saved as mkinitcpio.conf.pacsave - however, I recommend backing up this file before installing the modified mkinitcpio version.
